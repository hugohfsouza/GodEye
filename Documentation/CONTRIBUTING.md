# Contributing
When you want to contribute to this project, first open a discussion about the change in the Issue Tracker so that no two people are implementing or tampering with the same part of the code. We will be very happy to receive help.


## Processo de abertura de Pull Requests
1. Fork your github account.
2. Perform the implementation following the requirements described in this link. These are not very difficult requirements, they just help us to continue the project in the best possible way.
3. Create a pull request
4. Wait for feedback from maintainers and other contributors (we encourage as many reviewers as possible)
5. Track and interact with the feedback given. (Nobody owns the absolute truth)
6. As soon as two developers mark "ok" in their code, the PR will be merged
